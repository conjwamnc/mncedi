            JavaSquad was formed in November, 2018, by the wise and goal-driven Clementine Molema (who now holds the Project Manager 
            position at JavaSquad). After thorough research, Ms. Molema sourced the best individuals for her team, with hopes of not only 
            flourishing at the System Development project of the following year, but being amongst the top teams if not the top team itself.  
            Besides initail worries about the team working well together, it was later established that once the ice was broken, that was 
            the birth of JavaSquad - and success was imminent. Today JavaSquad is a multibillion software corporation, developing the best
            solution for any and all business needs.
