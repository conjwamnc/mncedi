            This woman is the powerhouse behind JavaSquad. Graduating amongst the top of her class, she completed her BCOM 
            degree from Rhodes Univeristy in April 2020 - achieving distinctions in both her majors. Project management is
            not only her passion, she is also exceptional at her work. Apart from being a cutting edge leader in the boardroom,
            she always has time for a good laugh - being the limelight of any event. Her bubbly personality is welcoming, 
            accomodating, and extremely addictive. She is a goal driven woman, who fears nothing and no one who dares stand in her
            way.
